## Lessons Learned

This project was one of the first ones I did trying to utilize all the tools studied from my course works and video walkthroughs. It's a culmination of everything I learned over my educational journey. One of the challenges I faced was picking a layout that was challenging yet allows for a strong user experience. I found numeros resources and made a folder of dos and don'ts for my site to make it standout.
